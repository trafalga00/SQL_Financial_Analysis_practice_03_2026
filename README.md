# SQL Financial Analysis — Nexus Commerce

## Project Overview
Retail sales analysis for Nexus Commerce, a fictional large-scale U.S. e-commerce retailer. This project demonstrates SQL querying skills using a multi-table relational dataset.

> ⚠️ **Practice Project** — Self-study project using fictional data for learning and demonstrating SQL and Excel skills.

## Dataset
- nexus_orders.csv — 1,500 transactions (2022–2024)
- nexus_customers.csv — 200 customers across 15 U.S. states
- nexus_products.csv — 80 products across 8 categories
- nexus_gl.csv — Quarterly General Ledger entries by region

## Key Questions Answered
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- How does customer segment affect average order value and discount rate?
- What is the year-over-year gross profit trend?
- Which states drive the most sales by category?

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Level 1: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- Level 2: GROUP BY, HAVING, Aggregate Functions
- Level 3: Multi-table JOIN, Table Aliases
  
## Excel Skills Demonstrated
- Pivot Table: Average unit price and gross margin rate analysis by category
- VLOOKUP: Product lookup by name to retrieve unit price and gross margin

## Tools Used
- SQLite / DB Browser for SQLite
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, VLOOKUP)

## Query 1-3
- List of products sorted by category, then by unit price from highest to lowest, showing product name, category, unit price, and gross margin percentage.
```sql
SELECT product_name, category, unit_price, gross_margin_pct
FROM nexus_products
ORDER BY category, unit_price DESC;
```

## Query 11-14
- List of returned orders, sorted by total amount from highest to lowest, showing order ID, date, total amount, and payment method.
```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount, payment_method
FROM nexus_orders
WHERE is_returned = 'Y'
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

## Query 14-21
**Question:** Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- Category-level sales summary — showing total orders, revenue, and average order value per category, sorted by highest revenue first. Joins orders with products to get the category info.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM nexus_orders o
JOIN nexus_products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## Query 22-31
**Question:** What is the year-over-year gross profit trend?
- Year-over-year gross profit trend — showing total revenue, gross profit, and GP margin % by fiscal year, excluding cancelled orders.

```sql
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y', order_date) AS fiscal_year,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(gross_profit) AS total_gross_profit,
    ROUND(SUM(gross_profit) * 100.0 / SUM(total_amount), 1) AS gp_margin_pct
FROM nexus_orders
WHERE order_status != 'Cancelled'
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year;
```

## Query 33-41
**Question:** Which states drive the most sales by category?
- State and category sales breakdown — showing order count and revenue per state/category combo, sorted by state then highest revenue. Joins orders with both customers and products.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.state,
    p.category,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM nexus_orders o
JOIN nexus_customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN nexus_products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.state, p.category
ORDER BY c.state, total_revenue DESC;
```


## Query 46-55
**Question:** How does customer segment affect average order value and discount rate?
- Customer segment breakdown — showing average order value and discount rate per segment, sorted by highest average order value. Joins orders with customers to get segment info.

```sql
SELECT
  c.customer_segment,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS unique_customers,
  COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
  ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount), 2) AS avg_order_value,
  ROUND(AVG(o.discount_rate), 1) AS avg_discount_rate,
  SUM(o.gross_profit) AS total_gross_profit
FROM nexus_orders o
JOIN nexus_customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_segment
ORDER BY avg_order_value DESC;
```

## What I Learned
- Practiced multi-table JOINs to connect orders, customers, and products
- Used GROUP BY with aggregate functions to answer business questions
- Applied HAVING to filter grouped results
- Gained confidence structuring queries from scratch

## Next Steps
- Upload Excel analysis (Pivot Table, VLOOKUP)
- Visualize key findings with charts
